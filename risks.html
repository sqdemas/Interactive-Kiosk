        <h2>Ethical Issues</h2>
        <p>When giving up personal data, users place trust in companies to use their data ethically and store their information safely. Unfortunately, data collection is fraught with ethical and security issues.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Lack of Transparency & Autonomy</p>
            <p>The data collection industry has long been criticized for lack of transparency in their practices. Further, many companies require individuals to give up their personal information just to access the service and do not allow users to choose how their data is used.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Data Leakage</p>
            <p>Though most datasets are anonymized, many separate data points can be combined to create a unique user profile that can be linked with a specific individual. This phenomenon is known as data leakage and compromises individual privacy.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px;">AI Inferences</p>
              <p>AI algorithms trained on large datasets can make accurate inferences about a person's behavior, including sexual orientation or political views, which they may not be comfortable having assumed. Many find this to be an invasion of privacy.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Security Risks</p>
            <p>Data is widely regarded as one of the most valuable resources in the modern age. Thus, remote servers with large amounts of data are highly sought after and vulnerable to hacks and data breaches. </p>
